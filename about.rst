About Me
========

My name is Michael Merickel and I'm interested in web and mobile development,
computer vision, image processing and image segmentation. I'm also an avid
player of ultimate frisbee and disc golf, as well as soccer, skiing and
raquetball.

I'm currently employed by
`Digital Artefacts <http://www.digitalartefacts.com>`_ where I work on web
design, iPhone/iPad apps, museum exhibits, embedded projects, and many other
things.

In my free time I'm involved in the `Pyramid <http://pylonsproject.org>`_
web framework, contributing patches and providing assistance in any way I can.
Most of my open source efforts are devoted to all things Python.

I received my Masters in `ECE <http://www.ece.engineering.uiowa.edu>`_ from
the `University of Iowa <http://uiowa.edu>`_ in 2007. While there, I studied
medical image analysis in the context of image segmentation using graph-based
algorithms.
