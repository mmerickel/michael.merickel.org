Research
========

This is an attempt to summarize some of the research I completed while working
on my Masters project in medical imaging.

`Optic Disc Segmentation <optic-disc>`__
-------------------------------------------------

The cup-to-disc ratio is an important statistic in diagnosing glaucoma.
However, segmentation must be done manually which is quite tedious and
time-consuming. Also there is large variability between specialists. This
research is an attempt to apply graph search techniques to the segmentation
problem in an attempt to improve upon current pixel classification techniques.
